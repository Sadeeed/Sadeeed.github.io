However, my trusty thinkpad recently died (RIP ðŸª¦) and since there was no replacement thinkpad available at work I was given a mac instead. I was a little hesitant at first but I decided to give it another try. I thought I would share some of the things I have done to make it feel more like my linux environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
